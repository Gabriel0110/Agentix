advanced_team_collaboration_example.py

This example demonstrates the use of AdvancedAgentTeam for collaborative problem-solving where:
1. Agents have specialized roles with custom query transformations
2. Agents communicate with each other through shared memory
3. The team runs in an interleaved manner, where each agent builds on others' insights
4. The process continues until convergence criteria are met
5. Advanced hooks track the progress of the collaboration

This pattern is particularly useful for complex problem-solving that requires
iterative refinement from different perspectives working together.
