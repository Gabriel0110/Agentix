agent_team_summarizer_example.py

This example demonstrates the use of AgentTeam with a summarizer pattern, where:
1. Three specialized domain agents work on a problem in parallel
2. Their outputs are collected and sent to a summarizer agent
3. The summarizer agent creates a cohesive final response

This pattern is useful for complex queries that benefit from multiple perspectives,
ensuring the user gets a comprehensive, well-structured answer that incorporates
insights from all domain experts.
