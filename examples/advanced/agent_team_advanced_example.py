agent_team_advanced_example.py

Demonstrates advanced synergy:
1) Shared memory among multiple agents
2) Interleaved chat approach for multi-agent analysis
   - Round-robin the agents in a while loop until a convergence condition is met
3) Aggregator agent merges everything into a final answer

Note: This example showcases very advanced usage. Not everything is necessary, but
it demonstrates the full capabilities of the AdvancedAgentTeam class. Pick and choose
the features that are most relevant to your use case.
