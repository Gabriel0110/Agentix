content_creation_team.py

A simple example demonstrating how to use autonomous agents in a team
for content creation. The team consists of:
1. Research Agent: Gathers information on the topic
2. Outline Agent: Creates a structured outline
3. Writer Agent: Generates the content
4. Editor Agent: Refines and improves the content
